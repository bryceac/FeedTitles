==Description== 

This plugin  combines the functionality of the following three plugins:

<ul>
<li>[https://github.com/bryceac/TagTitle Tag Title]</li>
<li>[https://github.com/bryceac/PostTitle Post Title]</li>
<li>[https://github.com/bryceac/CommentTitle Comment Title]</li>
</ul>

Separately, the first item manipulates the feed title for tag feed, while the second and third deal with feed titles of the comment feeds, and they all manipulate the subtitles for their respective feeds.
